First of all, disregard the "Guardian Roguelike" solution name. It was chosen with grander and more 
foolhardy plans in mind.

The name is "Run, Urist, Run!" and follows Urist McDwarf, a new immigrant to a fortress somewhere in the 
world. His luck is very short-lived though, as he arrives just before a megabeast attack! Now the fortress
is in shambles and Urist is pursued by some quick beast into the fortress' megaproject, an obsidian silo,
wielding only his trusted copper pick(Which can't scratch the obsidian borders) and the wings his fear gives
him. The player now takes control of Urist with certain death from the chasing megabeast above and probable
death from the dark forces below, who're taking the chance to invade the once rich fortress. Urist must 
descend the megaproject, stealing equipment from the dark forces or finding dwarven same and growing more 
skilled in the dealing of death until he either is strong enough to slay the chasing beast or find the 
rumored escape tunnel leading to the other side of the mountain.
